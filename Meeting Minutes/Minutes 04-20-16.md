##Tasks for this week

###Hau
1. Talked to LID and turned out carbon fiber tube can't be modified in LID due to hazard. The dust of carbon fiber is dangerous. 
2. Talked to rocket group since they work with carbon tube and might have tool to do the job. However, there is access and permission I need to have for getting in their lab.
3. Found a friend who has a tool, but he's not available until Friday.   

###Sabin
1. Python code works. 
2. Debug C++ code since Image processing and camera is in C++ code. 
3. When have the code working, test plan is to be written.

###Kainoa
1. To power the Edison board with extermal supply, we will need either Intel breakout board and arduino board. The Vsys on GPIO board could supply but no more than 4.1V
2. Since Ben ordered new breakout board, move on to next task (task #157)

###Ben 
1. Orderred two breakout board: one will go to Micheal and one will go to our group.
