1. Demo hover functions. Battery ran low, so Demo wasn't completed

##Hover's function
Hover function compares current altitude to desired altitude and output (either increase or decrease) throttle values to get to desired altitude.
1. Take 2 inputs: Constant height and current height.  
2. Output: throttle values. 
3. Optional Input: Battery Level.
