##Tasks for this week

###Hau
1. Flip 1.5 broken USB discussion: Can't use the oven because of the plastic on the pin headers. Micro USB connector also has plastic cover pins inside, so the possible method would be using the heat gun carefully heatup the pads. However, it was unsuccessfully because the plastic inside of adapter melted too quickly.
2. Received drone arm-tube.
3. Received OTG cable. 


###Sabin
1. Keep on researching on how to interface with Flip 1.5 using Intel Edison.
2. USB connector is broken, but it's possible to use TX and RX to interface and edit the firmware. 

###Kainoa
1. Got the camera showing side by side between calibration and without calibration. 
2. Will keep working on camera calibration
3. Order new flip 1.5
